# SERGIO - Data Analysis Portfolio
## About
I'm a recent computer science graduate from Binus University, and I'm enchanted by data analytics that is all about using data to make smart decisions and drive innovation. Currently, I am actively honing my skills in data analytics, with a particular focus on SQL, Excel, Python, and proficiently using visualization tools such as Tableau and Looker Data Studio. My fascination lies in working with numbers, transforming raw data into actionable insights, and crafting compelling narratives through data. I firmly believe that data is essential for enhancing business strategies, optimizing operational efficiency, and enabling data-driven, evidence-based decision-making.
